1b) A good quality cutoff for the index reads would be about 30. The plots show that the
lowest average bp positions are the first two bps. These average out to just above 30. Trimming
to 30 would get rid of most of the bad average reads due to the first two positions.

1c) grep -A 1 "^@" /projects/bgmp/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq | grep -v "^@" |
 grep -v "^-" | grep "N" | wc -l

number of Ns: 3976613

1d) The average quality score per read shows that the quality is really spread out, although 
there are a higher number of high quality reads compared to low quality.
